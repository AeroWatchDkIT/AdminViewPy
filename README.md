pip install flask

In order for the website to work properly, you must also run the backend code. If the backend code isn't working as expected, follow these steps:
- Open your package manager console.
- Run the following command to drop the database (make sure this is the intended action):
```bash
drop-database

```
- After dropping the database, run the program again:
```bash
python app.py

```
## If the issue persists, try updating the database:
```bash
update-database

```
